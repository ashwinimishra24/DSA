# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains a collection of C++ code files that implement various data structures and algorithms. The code is intended to serve as a reference for anyone interested in learning about or implementing these common programming constructs.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ashwinimishra24/DSA
```

Once you have the repository downloaded, you can navigate to the subdirectory that contains the specific data structure or algorithm you are interested in, and review the code files there. Each code file contains one or more C++ classes or functions that implement the given construct.

## Available Data Structures and Algorithms

Here are some of the data structures and algorithms currently available in this repository:

- Array
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Hash Map
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the existing code or would like to contribute a new data structure or algorithm, please feel free to create a pull request. I am always looking for ways to improve the code and make it more useful for the community.
